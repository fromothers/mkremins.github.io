==================
This repo hosts [my personal site](http://mkremins.github.io) and the code that compiles into it. It's heavily WIP and anything you see here is subject to change at a moment's notice.

Many thanks to the people and projects mentioned in [thanks.html](http://mkremins.github.io/thanks.html). Everything has dependencies, and I'm no exception.
