<p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Max Kreminski</strong>. I design games & user interfaces, conduct user research, program computers, write words, and study <a href="http://interactive.usc.edu/">Interactive Media & Games</a> as an undergraduate student at <a href="http://usc.edu">USC</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Affording Play</strong> is my blog. I mostly write about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UX design, UI design, and user research;</li>
  <li>games, interactive storytelling, and <a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/">explorable explanations</a>;</li>
  <li>learning, teaching, and psychology;</li>
  <li>creativity-enabling tools, especially programming tools; and</li>
  <li>anything else that happens to be on my mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">follow me on Twitter</a>. If you want, you can also email me; my address is just my name, as given above, at Gmail.</p>
