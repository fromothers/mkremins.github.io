<p>I'm Max Kreminski â€“ a storyteller, game designer, and computer programmer. I'm fascinated by all forms of creative expression, and I want to make it easier for humans to use computers to tell other humans their stories.</p>
<p>I spend some of my time on the <a href="http://remypas.com">RemyPas</a> Minecraft server, where I help out the community by developing and maintaining custom plugins for the <a href="http://bukkit.org">Bukkit</a> wrapper on top of which the server runs. Most of those plugins are open-source, and some are even packaged for stand-alone public distribution via <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/profiles/mkremins">BukkitDev</a>.</p>
<p>I'm fluent in Java, Objective-C, and English. (That last is probably debatable.)</p>
<p>This site, much like my life, is a work in progress. Feel free to pull up a chair, put up your feet, and watch it evolve.</p>
