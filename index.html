<p>I'm Max Kreminski â€“ a storyteller, game designer, and accidental computer programmer. I'm fascinated by Big Problems and prone to embarking on excessively ambitious projects.</p>
<p>My most frequently recurring obsession is creativity, and the various ways in which people can express their ideas. My ideal world is one in which anyone can easily share his or her own stories, and in which everyone recognizes that each person's stories are important in their own right.</p>
<p>I'm fluent in Java, HTML, CSS (and Sass), JavaScript, and English. I'm in the process of learning <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>, a Lisp dialect that emphasizes practicality over purity, and <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>, a fantastic little up-and-coming language that gets a shocking amount of stuff exactly right. If you value your sanity, don't ask me any questions about programming language design.</p>
<p>Much like my life, this site is a work in progress. Feel free to pull up a chair, put up your feet, and watch it evolve.</p>
