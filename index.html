<p>I'm Max Kreminski â€“ a storyteller, game designer, and computer programmer. I'm fascinated by all forms of creative expression, and I want to make it easier for humans to use computers to tell other humans their stories.</p>
<p>I'm fluent in Java, Objective-C, and English. I'm in the process of learning Ruby, HTML and CSS. I still haven't figured out how to keep a project limited in scope.</p>
<p>Much like my life, this site is a work in progress. Feel free to pull up a chair, put up your feet, and watch it evolve.</p>
